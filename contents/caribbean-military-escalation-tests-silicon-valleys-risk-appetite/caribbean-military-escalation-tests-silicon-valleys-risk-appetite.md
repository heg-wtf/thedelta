Unlike the Russia-Ukraine conflict that triggered energy price spikes, current tensions coincide with oil price weakness, creating unpredictable market dynamics that challenge investment strategies. The crisis forces venture capitalists to fundamentally rethink risk assessment as geopolitical volatility becomes a persistent condition rather than periodic shock, requiring startups to build resilience into their DNA from day one.

# Caribbean Military Escalation Tests Silicon Valley's Risk Appetite

**As US-Venezuela tensions reach critical levels, venture capitalists confront a geopolitical landscape that defies the Russia-Ukraine playbook**

The Caribbean is heating up, and Silicon Valley is taking notice. With the USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group now deployed to Latin American waters and US military operations claiming at least 40 Venezuelan lives since September, venture capitalists are grappling with a new brand of geopolitical uncertainty—one that doesn't fit neatly into the Russia-Ukraine war template they've spent three years learning to navigate.

The timing adds complexity to an already challenging investment landscape. Global VC funding reached approximately $97-120 billion in Q3 2025, marking four consecutive quarters above $100 billion. But beneath those headline numbers, geopolitical risk has climbed to the top of investor worry lists, and the Venezuela situation exemplifies why traditional risk models are breaking down.

Here's what makes this crisis different: Unlike Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine—which sent Brent crude soaring from $76 to over $110 per barrel—the current Caribbean escalation is actually coinciding with oil price weakness. WTI crude sits at $61.48 and Brent at $65.87 as of October 24, hovering near five-month lows. The EIA projects Brent will average just $62 per barrel through Q4 2025, dropping to $52 in 2026. Venezuela holds the world's largest proven oil reserves at 303 billion barrels, yet markets seem unconcerned about supply disruptions.

That disconnect should worry anyone betting on stable macro conditions. When Trump authorized CIA covert operations on October 15 and Maduro declared an external state of emergency on September 30, the predictable response would have been an energy price spike. Instead, we're seeing bearish sentiment driven by oversupply concerns and weak global demand. For founders and VCs alike, this creates a more insidious problem than the Russia shock: uncertainty without clear price signals.

The Russia-Ukraine comparison remains instructive for what could happen if tensions escalate further. That conflict reduced global GDP by 1.5% and added 1.3 percentage points to inflation. US diesel prices spiked 109% year-over-year by June 2022. The Fed's aggressive rate hikes to combat inflation triggered the VC funding collapse that the industry is still recovering from. Those macro headwinds demonstrated how quickly geopolitical events can cascade through startup balance sheets.

But there are critical differences. The current US operations remain maritime and covert rather than a land invasion. The 10,000 US troops now positioned in the Caribbean represent force projection, not occupation. And crucially, energy markets aren't reacting the way textbooks suggest they should—at least not yet. Recent oil price upticks of 5.6% came from Russian sanctions tightening, not Venezuela fears.

Currency markets tell a similar story of non-traditional risk. The dollar index has fallen 5.06% over the past twelve months, currently sitting at 99.0389. Geopolitical tensions typically boost safe-haven dollar demand, but fiscal uncertainty and trade tensions are overwhelming that dynamic. For venture-backed companies with cross-border operations—particularly those in Latin America's booming tech hubs—this creates planning nightmares that compound the direct military risk.

The investment landscape is bifurcating in response. AI startups captured 46.4% of all VC funding in Q3, a record concentration that suggests capital is fleeing to perceived safer bets with clear demand drivers. Defense tech continues attracting interest as government spending rises. But consumer startups face mounting headwinds: customer acquisition costs are climbing while discretionary spending weakens, creating a squeeze that geopolitical uncertainty amplifies.

What makes the Venezuela situation particularly challenging for VCs is its unpredictability. The Trump administration frames operations as counternarcotics enforcement, while Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez accuses Washington of attempting to "steal our oil, gas, and gold resources." The Maduro regime has reportedly offered to open all Venezuelan energy projects to US companies in exchange for avoiding full-scale conflict—a sign of just how high the stakes have climbed for both sides.

For founders navigating this environment, the implications are stark. Due diligence now routinely includes scenario planning for sudden energy price shocks, supply chain disruptions, and currency volatility—even when current indicators suggest stability. The era of ignoring macro factors in favor of pure growth metrics is definitively over. Capital efficiency and resilience have become table stakes, not differentiators.

The broader lesson extends beyond Venezuela. Geopolitical risk has fundamentally changed from a periodic shock to a persistent condition. Whether the Caribbean tensions escalate into full military conflict or de-escalate through diplomacy, the underlying volatility won't disappear. Russia-Ukraine demonstrated that conflicts can persist for years. China-Taiwan tensions simmer constantly. Middle East instability remains evergreen.

Silicon Valley built its success on long-term optimism and tolerance for technical risk. But October 2025 demands a different calculation: geopolitical risk isn't just another variable in the investment memo anymore. It's becoming the primary lens through which every other assumption must be stress-tested. The startups that survive the next downturn won't be the ones that ignored these risks or the ones that let fear paralyze them—they'll be the ones that learned to build resilience into their DNA from day one.

In a world where carrier strike groups deploy and oil prices fall simultaneously, conventional wisdom is the riskiest bet of all.
